## November 02, 2020
{: #whats-new-11-02-2020}



{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform  now supports the Fabric v2.x smart contract lifecycle that allows for decentralized governance of smart contract definitions on a channel. The platform has been updated to support Kubernetes v1.16-v1.18 and OpenShift container Platform 4.4, 4.5.

**Support for Fabric v2.x lifecycle**

The series of processes around installing, managing, and using smart contracts, collectively known as the "lifecycle" of the smart contract, has been updated. This new lifecycle allows organizations to collaborate in the channel-level decision making process regarding smart contracts, eliminate the need for smart contract fingerprint matches, and allow smart contracts to be written with only the code relevant to an organization's business role.

The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Developer tooling has been updated to support generation of Fabric v2.x smart contract packages as well as testing smart contracts by using the new lifecycle process. Learn more about how to [deploy a smart contract using Fabric v2.x](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts-v2) and [how to write powerful smart contracts](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-write-powerful-smart-contracts) that leverage the new governance.

**New process for enabling Hardware Security Module (HSM) support**

A new process for configuring an HSM to work with your blockchain nodes is available and offers faster performance over the use of the existing HSM PKCS #11 proxy which is now deprecated. Current customers who are using the PKCS #11 proxy should check out the new process in the [Advanced deployment](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-build-docker) options.

**Ability to upgrade existing nodes and channel application capability to Fabric v2.x**

You continue to have the option to select the Fabric v1.4 or v2.x image when creating your CAs, peers, and ordering nodes. However, you now have the ability to upgrade your existing nodes that are running Fabric v1.4.x to the Fabric v2.x image. If you have peers using the Fabric v1.4.x image, you must upgrade your nodes and update your channel capabilities to take advantage of the new smart contract lifecycle.

For information about upgrading nodes, check out [Upgrading to a new version of Fabric](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern-components#ibp-console-govern-components-upgrade). For information about updating the capabilities of your channels, check out [Capabilities](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern#ibp-console-govern-capabilities).

**Enhancements to the certificate renewal process**

Because all actions on a blockchain network depend on the existence of valid and verifiable certificates, renewing certificate is vital to avoiding network outages. To streamline the certificate renewal process, the console now allows you to renew your CA TLS certificate, and peer and ordering node enrollment and TLS certificates. While it is preferable to renew certificates before they expire, it is possible to restore components whose certificates have already expired in many cases. Learn more about the new options in [Certificate management](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-cert-mgmt#cert-mgmt-cert-types).



See the [Release notes](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-release-notes-saas-20#11-02-2020) for more details on the new features that are included in this release.



## August 27, 2020
{: #whats-new-08-19-2020}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform can now be deployed onto OpenShift clusters from the Red Hat Marketplace, an open cloud catalog that makes it easier to discover and access certified software. Red Hat certified {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator images are available in the marketplace and accessible from your OpenShift web console. This new deployment option is immediately available to deploy on any Red Hat OpenShift 4.3+ cluster, and provides a fast, integrated experience for deploying the blockchain console that can be used to create Certificate Authorities (CAs), peers, and ordering nodes, in the public cloud. See [Deploy from Red Hat Marketplace](/docs/blockchain-sw-251?topic=blockchain-sw-251-deploy-ocp-rhm) to learn how.


## June 18, 2020
{: #whats-new-06-18-2020}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform provides tighter integration with Red Hat solutions, including additional integration with Red Hat OpenShift 4.3 and support for Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces. This latest release also makes available a set of Ansible Content Collections to help accelerate the deployment of blockchain solutions.

**IBM Blockchain Platform Ansible Playbooks**  

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform improvements are designed to enable enterprises to launch production blockchain networks faster. This release helps organizations accelerate deployment through support of Ansible, an open source tool that automates provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. **Ansible Content Collections** are packages of modules, plug-ins, and other Ansible content that automate these processes. The platform has published a set of Ansible Content Collections to help organizations deploy blockchain components and networks with greater speed. See [Getting started with Ansible playbooks on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform](/docs/blockchain-sw-251?topic=blockchain-sw-251-ansible) to learn more.

**Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces**  

The platform expands its developer tool ecosystem with **Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces**, that help organizations speed up and simplify the set up of blockchain development environments. Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces provide a preconfigured and shared runtime environment that enables cloud-native blockchain development to be performed across teams. Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces offer strong security and adhere to enterprise-grade compliance for cloud-native development. Read about the [benefits of CodeReady Workspaces](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-develop-vscode#develop-vscode-crw-why) to learn more.

**Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 images**

This release also includes improved usability and security by using **Hyperledger Fabric v2** and introduces the capability to deploy new peer and ordering nodes based on either Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.7 or v2.1.1. While all of the new Fabric v2 capabilities are not yet available on the platform, when you deploy a peer based on the Fabric v2.1.1 image, smart contracts are deployed into their own pod rather than inside a container on the peer pod, eliminating the dependency on the Docker daemon. Deploying peer and ordering nodes with the Fabric v2.x images is recommended to ensure that going forward you have access to the latest Fabric fixes and features. It is not currently possible to migrate existing nodes to Fabric 2.1.1 images.  The ordering service requires that all ordering nodes be running either Fabric v1.4.x or Fabric 2.x. Mixing ordering nodes with these different Fabric versions can introduce problems when attempting to update the consenter set. Peers, on the other hand can coexist on a channel even when they run different Fabric levels, as long as the channel application capability is not higher than the lowest peer Fabric version. **Customers running OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} should upgrade their clusters to 4.3 now to fully take advantage of these new features.**


See the [Release notes](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-release-notes-saas-20#06-18-2020) for more details on the new features that are included in this release.

## May 20, 2020
{: #whats-new-05-20-2020}

In addition to being able to link your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform instance to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes service cluster, you can now also link your platform service instance to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster that is running in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The process is identical, the only difference is that when you link a cluster, you can now select your OpenShift cluster from the list of available clusters. See [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks) to review the deployment process.

If you are an Enterprise customer who is migrating to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, you must link your blockchain service instance to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes service cluster. OpenShift clusters are not supported for Enterprise migration.

{: #whats-new-2-14-2019}

Enterprise Plan users can now upgrade their networks to the latest version of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. As part of the upgrade process, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will upgrade your Enterprise Plan network from Fabric v1.1 to Fabric v1.4.3 and migrate your ordering service from Kafka to Raft consensus. You can then use the self guided upgrade tool to create new nodes on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.0 side by side with your Enterprise Plan network. For more information about the upgrade process, see [Upgrading to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-enterprise-upgrade#enterprise-upgrade).

If possible, Enterprise Plan customers are encouraged to migrate to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.0 right away. If you do not need to preserve your ledger data on Enterprise Plan, you are encouraged to skip the upgrade process and create a new network on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. If you are ready to create a new network, go to [Getting Started with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/blockchain/reference?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks#ibp-v2-deploy-iks).

Since the Enterprise Upgrade documentation was released as a preview, version 1.4.5 of the Fabric Node SDK has been released. If your application uses the Node SDK, you need to upgrade the SDK to version 1.4.5 before you start using the upgrade tool.

### Reminders for Starter Plan users
{: #whats-new-10-02-2019-reminders}

**Admin certificates for Starter plan instances expire one year from date of service instance creation.**
- When an admin certificate expires, you are no longer able to perform operations from the UI.  Admin certificates cannot be renewed because Starter Plan has been deprecated. 
- If you want to continue using Starter Plan after your admin certificate expires, you need to reset your network. Your network is reset back to the original one channel, two peers and one peer per organization. Any new nodes, channels, and smart contracts you have added since your Starter network was originally deployed need to be recreated in the new network.
- If you no longer need to use Starter Plan, now would be a good time to deploy a new instance of the next generation {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform. You can [preview the platform for free](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing#ibp-saas-pricing-free) for 30 days.

**There is no migration from Starter Plan to the next generation {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}}, but your chaincode can be reused.**
- Check out this [tutorial series](https://developer.ibm.com/series/ibm-blockchain-platform-console-video-series/){: external} to learn how to deploy the blockchain console and build a network.
- [Create](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing#ibp-saas-pricing-free){: external} your next generation {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform instance.
- See [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks){: external}.
- Check out our [FAQs](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-faq).   

### The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console UI has been updated
{: #whats-new-10-02-2019-Console}

Review the [release notes](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-release-notes-saas-20) to see the latest features available for your network.

## August 27, 2019
{: #whats-new-8-27-2019}

The process to view logs for Starter Plan nodes has changed. Instead of viewing Starter logs by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Log Analysis service and Kibana, you can now use the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to view the logs of your CA, peers and ordering nodes.

## August 7, 2019
{: #whats-new-8-7-2019}

Networks on Enterprise Plan will soon be upgraded to Fabric v1.4.3. The Upgrade allows your network to be migrated to a Raft based ordering service from Kafka.

This upgrade may cause breaking changes in your applications if they still use the peer based EventHub class of the Fabric SDKs. The peer based EventHub has been removed in Fabric v1.4.3. You must update your applications to use the new channel based event service. Because you can use channel events on Fabric v1.1, you can migrate your application at any time. For more information, see [How to use the channel-based event service](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-channel-events.html){: external} in the Node SDK documentation.

If you are using Hyperledger Composer v0.19.x, upgrading your network to Fabric 1.4.3 will disrupt your application. You need to plan on shutting down your application before upgrading your network. When your upgrade is complete, you can upgrade your application to Composer v0.20.8.

Fabric v1.4 is the first long term support release of Hyperledger Fabric. You can learn more by visiting the [Whats new in v1.4](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatsnew.html){: external} in the Fabric documentation.

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform releases {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private is an application platform for developing and managing containerized applications that are based on Kubernetes and it allows users to deploy Certificate Authorities (CAs), orderers, and peers on x86, LinuxONE and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Z. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private is based on Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.1 and is deployed by using Kubernetes Helm charts. After you install the Helm chart, you can find it as a bundled service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Catalog. Note that this offering is more suitable for experienced Fabric users.

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private v3.1.0 documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.0/kc_welcome_containers.html){: external}.

The release of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private also marks the end of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Remote Peer (Beta) program. It is still possible to deploy a peer in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private or in AWS and connect it to a Starter Plan or Enterprise Plan network.

This release also debuts some improvements to the documentation table of contents. If you are a Starter or Enterprise user, your content can still be found in the **LEARN**, **HOW TO**, **REFERENCE**, and **HELP** sections, and the links are still the same.
