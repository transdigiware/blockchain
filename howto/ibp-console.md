## Video script
{: #video-transcript-key-concepts}
{: notoc}

By now you’ve probably heard of the IBM Blockchain Platform, the leading permissioned enterprise blockchain solution in the world. But what is a permissioned blockchain? And what is the IBM Blockchain Platform? The modern world is interwoven and interactive place.

But under the surface it’s still following some pretty old rules.

Jerry here on the left uses a different record keeping system than Door2Door Logistics on the right, which means they have to spend a lot of time figuring out what the truth is before they can make a deal.

This process is not just slow, it’s vulnerable. A successful hack or other problem can mean records are lost forever. As a result, businesses sacrifice efficiency for security and lock their records away.

But what if businesses shared their records, and shared the burden of protecting them? What if Jerry’s Modern Fabrics and Door2Door Logistics and their business partners never had to spend time arguing over who’s right because every time an asset moves from one to the other everyone’s records updated at the same time? And what if those records, once written, could never been changed?

This network, leveraging what’s called Distributed Ledger Technology, already exists. It’s an open blockchain network like Bitcoin. But there’s a problem. Businesses don’t necessarily want the records of their transactions shared with everyone, especially in a network like Bitcoin where users are unknown. In some industries, it’s actually illegal to share data that way.

What Jerry’s Modern Fabrics and Door2Door Logistics need is a permissioned blockchain like IBM Blockchain Platform, where businesses can form networks with known, established partners and still take advantage of the robustness and efficiency of blockchains. But this too creates a problem. Who owns this network? Who runs it? The answer is: no one does.

Once an IBM Blockchain network has been established, its rules and practices are managed collectively, mimicking the kind of consensus process that governs the way transactions themselves are approved and written to the ledgers in the network.

But the IBM Blockchain Platform doesn’t just stop with permissions and identities, users also have the ability to create channels where a few members of a network can get together and transact privately.

Additionally, private data collections can be established, which allows a few channel members to share certain transactions just with each other, without needing a whole separate channel.

Because components are hosted in clusters that are owned and controlled by users, the IBM Blockchain Platform is naturally compliant with data residency rules.

All of these processes are managed through an award winning UI we call the console, which, along with custom APIs, makes the powerful open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain painless to use.

The console integrates seamlessly with the rest of the IBM Blockchain Platform suite, including a powerful VS Code extension which allows users to create and test smart contracts and applications and then package and install them on production networks.

Because the console can run on both IBM Cloud and any cloud supported by Red Hat’s Open Shift, the console can run nearly everywhere and consoles in different clouds can connect to each other and to nodes deployed on Hyperledger Fabric.

But how many CAs, which create identities and define organizations, do I need?

How many peers, which host ledgers and have smart contracts installed on them, should I deploy on a channel to make sure I have no downtime?

Because you only pay for the compute you use, it’s painless to transition from pilot programs to full production networks using the IBM Blockchain Platform. The IBM Garage is here to help assist you in finding the right configuration for every use case.

The world is moving too fast to keep doing things the old way. Go to cloud dot IBM dot com today and check out the IBM blockchain platform.


## What the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offers
{: #ibp-console-overview-capabilities}

This latest release is tailored to experienced {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} and Hyperledger Fabric users and lets them host and join {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} networks. If you are an existing Enterprise Plan customer, instead of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} managing your network, you now have total control with the ability to provision, monitor, and manage your components inside your own Kubernetes cluster.

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform includes the following key features:

**BUILD ---- Integrated developer experience**
- **Deploy easily**. Use Ansible Playbooks or the Red Hat Marketplace to deploy networks quicker than ever before.
- **Easily code** your [smart contracts](#x8888420){: term} in Node.js, Golang, Java, or JavaScript. Use the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Developer Tools to easily develop smart contracts locally or use Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces to develop them in the cloud. Leverage **SDK integration** with the console, and learn from our rich tutorials and samples.
- **Simplified DevOps** allows you to move from development to test to production in a single environment by scaling up your Kubernetes resources to add more components.
- **Up-to-date Fabric key features**. Choose which version of Hyperledger Fabric you want to use when deploying peers or ordering nodes. Leverage the latest features of Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.7 and v2.x:
  - [Smart contract lifecycle](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/chaincode_lifecycle.html){: external}
  - [Raft ordering service](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/orderer/ordering_service.html#raft){: external}
  - [Private data collections](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts#ibp-console-smart-contracts-private-data) that provide increased data privacy by ensuring that ledger data is shared to only authorized peers via the gossip protocol.
  - [Fabric Node OUs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/membership/membership.html#node-ou-roles-and-msps){: external}
  - [Service discovery](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/discovery-overview.html){: external}, allowing you to dynamically discover and update how your application interacts with your network.
  - [Channel access control lists](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/access_control.html){: external} that allow you additional control of the governance of your channels and smart contracts.

**OPERATE --- Total control of your deployments**
- **Host or join a network**. Deploy peers that are hosted in your cluster to multiple channels on multiple clouds, or invite other organizations to join your consortium or channels while the organizations manage their nodes independently across infrastructures.
- **Maintain complete control of your identities**. Store and manage the keys that are used to administer your nodes. Optionally, use a [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](#x6704988){: term} to generate and store the private key of your nodes.
- **Run Anywhere**. Thanks to the **unified codebase** of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console, it is possible to run your components on any environment supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and third-party public clouds.
- **Unified operation**. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console allows you to deploy and manage all of your organizations and nodes in **one console**. You can also add or remove members from a blockchain consortium, create and join channels, and install and instantiate smart contracts from your console.
- **Dynamic signature collection** that allows better control over collaborative governance over channel configurations.
- **Elimination of Docker-in-Docker for smart contracts** allows smart contract pods to be run more securely, without peers needing privileged access.
- **Manage access** of the users who can administer or monitor your nodes.
- **Interact directly with your pods** using the Kubernetes dashboard.
- **Direct access to the logs** of your nodes from your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Kubernetes service. Use the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} or any supported third-party service to extract and analyze your logs.
- **Kubernetes service integration.** Leverage services such as LogDNA for logging and Prometheus and Sysdig for monitoring. Leverage the built-in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service and OpenShift dashboards, {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM).

**GROW --- Scalability and flexibility**
- **Choose your compute**. You have the flexibility to decide the amount of CPU, memory, and storage you want to provision in your Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Allocating resources](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources).
- **Scale** up and down the resources in your Kubernetes cluster, paying for only what you need. For more information, see  [Pricing](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing).
- **Disaster recovery and multi-region high availability (HA).** This option duplicates your Kubernetes deployment across zones and  regions, enabling high availability (HA) of your components and disaster recovery (DR).
- **Connect to other Fabric networks**: Join {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform peers to any network running Hyperledger Fabric components. Similarly, you can invite Fabric peers to join channels hosted on an ordering service deployed on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. Note that you will need to use Hyperledger Fabric APIs or the CLI.

## Supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} configuration
{: #ibp-console-overview-supported-cfg}

**Reminder:** {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} 1.15 is no longer supported after **September 12, 2020**.  Customers can only upgrade their 1.14 clusters to 1.15 until that date. After September 12, 2020, **any clusters or worker nodes running 1.14 can no longer be upgraded and become unusable**. If you have any clusters running 1.14, then before September 12, 2020, you must upgrade the cluster and worker nodes to 1.15 and then ideally to 1.16 as well in order for them to remain functional and supported.  To get started, see [1.14 to 1.15 version considerations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#cs_v115) and  [1.15 to 1.16 considerations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#cs_v116). For the actual steps that are required, see [Updating clusters, worker nodes, and cluster components](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#update). For the list of {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} supported versions and expiration dates see the [release history](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#release-history).

## Considerations
{: #ibp-console-overview-considerations}

Before you deploy the console, ensure that you understand the following considerations:

- You are responsible for the management of health monitoring, security, and logging of your Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. See this [information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks){: external} for details on what {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} manages and what you are responsible for.
- You are also responsible for monitoring the resource usage of your Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. To monitor your Kubernetes resources, we recommend using the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Sysdig](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/sysdig){: external} tool in combination with your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes dashboard. If you need to increase storage capacity or performance of your cluster, see this information on how to [modify your existing volume](/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage#file_change_storage_configuration){: external}.
- You are responsible for managing and securing your certificates and private keys. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not store your certificates in the Kubernetes cluster or in the console. They are only kept in the local storage of your browser. If you switch browsers, you will have to import your created identities into that browser.
- {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform is available in select regions. Refer to this topic on [{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform locations](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-regions-locations) for an updated list.
- If you do not want to use the default Bronze File storage that is pre-selected for you when you provision a Kubernetes cluster in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can provision storage of your choice. See this topic on [Persistent storage considerations](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks#ibp-console-storage) to learn more.
- If you decide to include {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} multi-zone support in your Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must provision your own storage. See [Using Multizone (MZR) clusters with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks#ibp-console-mzr) for more details.
- You can preview the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform at no charge for 30 days when you link your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform service instance to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes free cluster. Performance will be limited by throughput, storage and functionality. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} will delete your cluster after 30 days and you cannot migrate any nodes or data from a free cluster to a paid cluster. If you choose a paid Kubernetes cluster instead of the limited free cluster, you will incur charges for the Kubernetes service to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
- Kubernetes clusters that are configured with private VLANs are not supported.

## Migration
{: #ibp-console-overview-migration}

Currently, migration from any {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} platform offering to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is not possible.

## License and pricing
{: #ibp-console-overview-license-and-pricing}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} introduces a new hourly pricing model based on virtual processor core (VPC) usage. The simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform nodes consume on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of **$0.29 USD/VPC-hour**, where **1 VPC = 1 CPU**. See this topic on [Pricing](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing) for more details.

## Getting started
{: #ibp-console-overview-deploy}

For information about how to deploy {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks#ibp-v2-deploy-iks).

For more information about how to use the console to start deploying nodes and building consortium, see the [Building your network](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network) tutorial. This tutorial guides you through the process of using the console to create a sample network with three organizations, one ordering organization, two peer organizations, and a channel with two peers joined to it. You can use this sample network to for demos or proofs of concept or adjust and expand the steps in the tutorial to create your own custom blockchain configuration.

## Architecture reference
{: #ibp-console-overview-architecture}

The following illustrations show the components of your blockchain network and how they interact with your cluster.

### IBM Blockchain Platform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service Architecture
{: #ibp-console-overview-architecture-iks}

![IKS Sample network structure](../images/cloudkubernetes.svg "{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service Architecture reference"){: caption="Figure 1. Architecture diagram of IBM Blockchain Platform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service" caption-side="bottom"}

Notice how a single instance of the console, also known as Operational Tooling, is created for each {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Service Instance. When a peer, orderer or CA node is deployed by using the console, it is deployed into the **Kubernetes Cluster Service Instance**.

| **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Kubernetes Cluster** | **Description** |
| ------------------------- |-----------|
| Operational Tooling | Also known as the `console`, this is your central user interface for operating all of your blockchain components. With this console you can now create CA, peer, and ordering nodes, create channels and install and instantiate smart contracts developed with the Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 VS Code extension. The console is deployed in an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-owned cluster. There is no charge for this tooling or the Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} where it runs.|

| **Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance** | **Description** |
| ------------------------- |-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Operator** | A Kubernetes operator that is used to deploy the console. |
| **Ingress** | A [Kubernetes object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/){: external} that allows access to the cluster resources from outside the cluster. |
| **Proxy** | The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform proxy is responsible for routing traffic to the correct peer, CA and ordering nodes by using host header routing. |
| **Peers, CAs, Ordering nodes** | These are the nodes that are created. Note: these nodes could also be imported from other Kubernetes Cluster Service Instances. Because the keys are never stored by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, every peer and orderer node includes a gRPC web proxy that allows the console to communicate with each node by using the keys in the wallet. |
| **RBAC** | Role based access control.  The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform configures [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/){: external} in the cluster which is required to manage blockchain components in the cluster.

{: #ibp-v2-deploy-iks-integrations}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform can leverage a suite of services provided in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog to enable users more visibility into their network or to integrate with other services.

![{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform integrations](../images/integrations-updated.png "{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Integrations"){: caption="Figure 2.{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Integrations" caption-side="bottom"}

**Access control**  
- Securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources using [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA-iam).

**Monitoring**  
- Use [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Activity Tracker with LogDNA](/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA-getting-started#getting-started) service to troubleshoot logs in real-time, diagnose issues, and identify problems in your Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

- Use [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Activity Tracker with Sysdig](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-getting-started#getting-started) to monitor the activity and the health of services and applications in the Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

- See this tutorial on how to [Analyze logs and monitor application health with LogDNA and Sysdig](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-application-log-analysis).

- The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform peers and orderers are automatically configured to expose a `/metrics` endpoint that Prometheus can use to scrape a wide variety of blockchain metric data. Read more about using [Prometheus in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-monitoring#prometheus){: external}.
