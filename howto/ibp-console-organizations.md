# Managing organizations
{: #ibp-console-organizations}



You can use the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform console to create a formal organization definition that is known as a Membership Services Provider (MSP). Your organization's MSP definition allows other members of the blockchain consortium to verify the identity of your nodes and applications. Your MSP definition also contains your organization's admin certificates.

You can also use the console to manage which organizations are members of your channel. The administrator of the ordering service can use the organizations tab to add members to the blockchain [consortium](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-glossary#glossary-consortium). Members of the channel can then use the console to add members to new or existing channels.

![{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console organizations tab](../images/console_organizations_tab.png "{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console organizations tab"){: caption="Figure 1. You can use the organizations panel to create, import, and manage organization MSP definitions" caption-side="bottom"}

**Target audience:** This topic is designed for network operators who are responsible for creating, monitoring, and managing the blockchain network.

## Understanding MSPs
{: #console-organizations-about-msp}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform is based on Hyperledger Fabric and builds permissioned blockchain networks. Participants need to be known to the network before they can submit transactions and interact with the assets on the ledger. Fabric recognizes identity through a group of invited organizations at the channel level. Organizations in the consortium are able to issue valid credentials to their members and let them become participants in the network. The participants can then operate blockchain nodes and submit transactions from client applications.

Each organization in a network needs to operate a Certificate Authority to create all of the identities for the admins and nodes that belong to your organization. These public-private keys pairs are issued by the CA and used by the members of your organization to sign and verify their actions. When an organization joins a channel, the public key of the CA associated with that organization allows other organizations to verify that your peers and applications are valid participants. For more information about membership in Hyperledger Fabric, see the [Membership concept topic](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/membership/membership.html){: external} in the Fabric documentation.

Before your organization can join a consortium, it needs to create an organization definition that is known as a **Membership Services Provider (MSP)**. The MSP contains the following information:
- A certificate signed by your **root Certificate Authority**. This certificate is used to verify the identity of your nodes, channels, and applications.
- A certificate signed by your **TLS CA**. A root TLS certificate allows your peers to participate in cross organization gossip, which is necessary to take advantage of the [Private data collections](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data/private-data.html#what-is-a-private-data-collection){: external} and [Service Discovery](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/discovery-overview.html){: external} features of Hyperledger Fabric.
- The **MSP ID**. The MSP ID is the formal name of your organization. You need to remember the MSP ID for your applications or when using the SDK to submit transactions.
- The **MSP display name**. This is an informal name that is given to your organization, which is used to identity your MSP in the console.
- The **Admin certificates** of your **Organization Admin** identities. These certificates are passed to the ordering service and are used to verify which identities in your organization are allowed to create or edit channels. When you use your console to create an ordering node or peer, the admin certificates inside the MSP are deployed within the new node, making your organization admin identities your **peer or orderer admins** as well. You can use these identities to operate your node, such as by installing a smart contract on a peer or joining a peer to a channel, from your console or a client application.

## Managing MSPs in the console
{: #ibp-console-organizations-manage}

Navigate to the **Organizations** tab. You can use this tab to [create an MSP definition](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-create-msp) by using a Certificate Authority that exists in your console. You can also use this tab to [import an MSP](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-import-msp) that was created by another organization.

You can view all of the MSPs that you created or imported under **Available organizations**. You can use the MSP definitions in the organizations tab for important functions within your console:
- If you are creating peer or ordering nodes, the MSP of your organization is used to identify the organization that the node belongs to.
- MSPs are used by organizations to verify the signatures of actions by other organizations. For this reason, you should export your MSP to every organization in the channel and likewise import the MSP of every organization.
- If your organization is one of the admins of the ordering service, you can [add new organizations to the consortium](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-add-consortium).
- If you are a member of the channel, you can import the MSPs of other organization into your console and then add the members to new or existing channels.

You can click an MSP definition in the organizations tab to view all of the nodes in the console that belong to each organization. Because each node was deployed with the administrator certificate from the MSP definition inside, you can use this panel to know which nodes are managed by which organization administrator.

## Creating an MSP for your organization
{: #console-organizations-create-msp}

Use the **Organizations** tab to generate an MSP definition for your organization. When you click **Create MSP definition**, a panel will open in which you will enter all the necessary information for your MSP.

- The **MSP definition details** tab is where you provide a display name and an MSP ID for the MSP. Use the tooltip to learn about the restrictions for the MSP ID.

- The **Root Certificate Authority details** tab is where the CA for your organization is specified. This is the CA that you use to register all of the identities associated for your organization. Before creating an MSP, you must register the admin of the MSP. If you use intermediate CAs, this is the CA that you used to create those CAs. Select your CA from the list of CAs managed by using your console. If you created a CA using the console, selecting a CA will also display the root TLS certificate of your TLS CA, which was deployed alongside your CA.

- You can also use the **Admin certificates** tab to generate the identity of your organization admin. If you already have an admin identity you want to make your organization admin, click **Existing identity** and select the identity from the drop-down list. If you want to use the panel to generate a new admin identity, you need to register your organization admin with your CA. You then need to complete the following steps in order to use these identities to operate your network:

  1. Enter the **Enroll ID** and **Enroll secret** of an admin identity that is registered with your CA. After you enter the enroll ID and enroll secret, choose a **Display name**. This name is used to represent the identity in the console.
  2. Click **Generate**. This generates a certificate and private key and automatically add the keys to your Wallet. You can then find your admin identity in your Wallet by using the name that you selected on this panel. These keys are only stored in your browser local storage. Therefore, if you change browsers, they will not be in your Wallet. This is why you should click **Export** to export this identity to your local file system. If you switch browsers, you will need to import the identity from your file system into the Wallet of your new browser.
  3. Then, click **Export** to download the key pair to your file system and secure them.

- The **Administrators certificate** section of the side panel contains the signing certificates keys of your admins. The certificate that you generated by clicking **Generate** in the section above can be found in the first row of the field. If you want to use multiple admin identities to operate your network, you can paste additional certificates into **admin certificate** fields.

Because your admin certs are passed to your nodes and channels by using the MSP definition, you need to ensure that each of your node and organization admin certificates is stored in the MSP. When you use the console to create an orderer, peer, or channel, you need to **Associate** one of the identities you exported in your Wallet with the admin certificates that were provided to the MSP definition. When you encounter an **Associate identity** section or panel, select an identity that you generated and saved to the Wallet when creating the MSP definition.

- On the **Review MSP information** panel, review the information that you specified for this MSP.

After you have selected your CA, MSP ID, and either specified or created an admin, click **Create MSP definition**. It should now be listed as an organization in the Organizations tab. Because an MSP is the representation of an organization in the network, you select the MSP definition when you deploy your nodes (identifying the organization the node belongs to), are joined to the consortium (by an ordering service admin), create a channel, join a channel, edit a channel, or perform any action where you have to specify the organization that is performing the action.

## Downloading a connection profile
{: #ibp-console-organizations-connx-profile}

After you create an organization MSP definition and create peers with that organization MSP definition, you can download a connection profile that can be used by a client application to connect to your network via one or more gateway peers. The gateway peers are the peers that are specified in the connection profile, and they are used to perform service discovery to find all of the endorsing peers in the network that will endorse transactions.

Click the **Organization MSP** tile for the organization that your client application interacts with. Click **Create connection profile** to open a side panel where you can build and download your connection profile.

  ![Create connection profile panel](../images/create-connx-profile.png "Create connection profile panel")

If you plan to use the client application to register and enroll users with the organization CA, you need to include the Certificate Authority in the connection profile definition.

Select the peers to include in the connection profile definition. When a peer is not available to process requests from a client application, service discovery ensures that the request is automatically sent to a different peer. Therefore, to accommodate for peer downtime during a maintenance cycle for example, it is recommended that you select more than one peer for redundancy. In addition to peers created by using the console or APIs, imported peers that have been imported into the console are eligible to be selected as well.

The list of channels that the selected peers have joined is also provided for your information. If a channel is missing from the list, it is likely because the peer joined to it is currently unavailable.

You can then download the connection profile to your local file system and use it with your client application to generate certificates and invoke smart contracts.

The connection profile that is downloaded from the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console can only be used to connect to your network by using the Node.js (JavaScript and TypeScript) and Java Fabric SDKs.
{: note}

The generated connection profile only supports Fabric CAs. If you manually built your organization MSP with certificates from an external CA, the connection profile will not include any information "certificate authorities": section.


### Including a certificate authority in a connection profile
{: #ibp-console-organizations-connx-profile-ca}

If you plan to use a client application to register and enroll users with the organization CA, then you need to include the associated CA in the connection profile.

If the CA that is associated with the MSP resides in a different console, when you attempt to download the connection profile you see a warning message and the ``"certificateAuthorities:"`` section of the generated connection profile is empty.

![Create connection profile warning panel](../images/create-connx-profile2.png "Create connection profile panel"){: caption="Figure 3. You can use the organizations panel to create, import, and manage organization MSP definitions" caption-side="bottom"}

The generated connection profile without the CA information resembles:

```json
{
  "name": "org1profile",
  "description": "Network on IBP v2",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "client": {
      "organization": "org1"
  },
  "organizations": {
      "org1": {
          "mspid": "org1",
          "certificateAuthorities": [
              "xyz-ca.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443"
          ],
          "peers": [
              "va0414-ba-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443",
              "va0414-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443"
          ]
      }
  },
  "peers": {
      "xyz-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443": {
          "url": "grpcs://xyz-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443",
          "tlsCACerts": {
              "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----nnnnnn-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
          },
          "grpcOptions": {
              "ssl-target-name-override": "xyz-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud"
          }
      },
      "va0414-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443": {
          "url": "grpcs://va0414-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443",
          "tlsCACerts": {
              "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----nnnnnn-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
          },
          "grpcOptions": {
              "ssl-target-name-override": "va0414-peer.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud"
          }
      }
  },
  "certificateAuthorities": {}
}
```

But if the `"certificateAuthorities"` section is empty and client application needs to register and enroll identities with the CA from the connection profile, then you must manually add the CA information to the generated connection profile. To get the CA connection information, simply export the CA, from the console where it resides, to a JSON file:

  1. From the nodes panel, open the CA.
  2. Click the **Export** icon to download the CA configuration to a JSON file.

    ![Export CA](../images/ca-export.png "Export your CA"){: caption="Figure 4. Click the export icon to download the CA configuration to a JSON file." caption-side="bottom"}

    The downloaded _CA JSON file_ resembles:

    ```
    {
        "display_name": "brian ca",
        "api_url": "https://xyz-ca.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443",
        "operations_url": "https://xyzca-operations.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443",
        "type": "fabric-ca",
        "ca_name": "ca",
        "tlsca_name": "tlsca",
        "tls_cert": "LS0tLS1...bE1UQm1OVGd",
        "name": "brian ca",
        "pem": "LS0tLS1...bE1UQm1OVGd",
        "ca_url": "https://xyz-ca.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443"
    }
    ```

  3. Open the _generated connection profile_ that you downloaded. Edit the `"certificateAuthorities":` section:

    ```
    "certificateAuthorities": {
        "<CA_HOST_PORT>": {
            "url": "<API_URL>",
            "caName": "<CA_NAME>",
            "tlsCACerts": {
                "pem": ["<TLS_CERT>"]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace:

    - `<CA_HOST_PORT>` with the value of the `"certificateAuthorities":` from the `"organizations":` section of the generated connection profile. For example, `xyz-ca.openshift-ibpv2-test-1-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443`.
    - `<API_URL>` with the value of the `"api_url"` from the downloaded JSON file.
    - `<CA_NAME>` with the value of the `"ca_name"` from the downloaded JSON file.
    - `<TLS_CERT>` with the value of the `"tls_cert"` from the downloaded JSON file.

If the organization MSP was manually created by using certificates from an external CA, then there is no reason to add the CA to the connection profile. You cannot register and enroll users with an external CA from a client application.

## Updating an organization MSP definition
{: #ibp-console-govern-update-msp}

It is possible that you will need to update an organization MSP definition, such as the display name or the certificates that are included inside the MSP.

It is recommended that you do not change the `msp_id` field as this might cause breaking changes to your network.
{: important}

To update your MSP:

- Export the existing MSP definition from the **Organizations** tab and edit the generated JSON file to modify the display name, the existing certificates, or add new certificates.
- Click your MSP definition in the **Organizations** tab to open it, click the **Settings** icon, and then click **Add file** to upload the new JSON file.
- Click **Update MSP definition**.
- Re-export this MSP to all of the members of the network.

If you need to add a new admin certificate to an existing organization MSP definition, refer to the following tasks:
- Add the certificate of an additional member of the peer's organization who can list and install a smart contract on a peer. See this section for [instructions](#ibp-console-organizations-new-admins).
- Add the certificate of an additional member of the channel's operator organization who can instantiate a smart contract on an **existing** channel and can submit and approve updates to the channel. See this section for [instructions](#ibp-console-organizations-new-admins-existing-channel).

### Adding a new peer or orderer admin certificate
{: #ibp-console-organizations-new-admins}

Because peer and orderer administrators can change over time, or because admin certificates expire every year, you will need to update your MSP admin certificates. You can add new peer or orderer administrators by updating their associated organization MSP definition to include the admin certificates of additional admin identities or new certificates to replace expired ones. Recall that a peer admin identity is required to install a smart contract on a peer and list the smart contracts that are already installed on the peer. When the certificate expires, the peer admin will no longer be able to install smart contracts on the peer.

When you update an MSP organization definition with a new admin cert, the associated peer or orderer nodes are also updated with the modified MSP definition. This update process includes an automatic restart of the associated nodes, which means they are unavailable for a brief period of time while they restart. If client applications are sending transactions to the nodes during this period, the transactions might need to be resubmitted. Note that imported peer or ordering nodes, or nodes that were not created by using your console, are not updated.
{: important}

#### Before you begin
{: #ibp-console-organizations-new-admins-before}

In order to complete this process, you need to generate new certificates for the admin identity. If you already have the certificates because you re-enrolled an existing admin identity after its certificate expired, you can skip this section. Otherwise, you need to register and enroll the new peer or orderer admin identity with the same CA that the existing peer or orderer admin was registered with.

1. Follow the steps to [register a new peer or orderer admin identity](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-identities#ibp-console-identities-register).
2. Follow the steps to [enroll the new admin identity](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-identities#ibp-console-identities-enroll), which generates the Certificate and private key for the new admin identity. Be sure to download the generated certificate and private key PEM files to your file system and add the identity to your Wallet.
3. If the certificate was not created by the console, for example if the Fabric CA client or Fabric SDK was used to generate the certificate, then you need to convert the certificate string from PEM format to base64 format by running the following command:

```
export FLAG=$(if [ "$(uname -s)" == "Linux" ]; then echo "-w 0"; else echo "-b 0"; fi)
cat <certificate.pem> | base64 $FLAG
```
{: codeblock}

Replace `<certificate.pem>` with the name of the certificate PEM file that you downloaded.

#### Node Organizational Unit (OU) support
{: #ibp-console-organizations-nodeous}

Recall that when you register a user with the CA, you need to select a user **Type** of `client`, `peer`, `orderer`, or `admin`, that is used to confer a "role" onto the identity. Roles are referred to as **Organizational Units (OU)** inside a certificate. The `admin` and `orderer` types were added to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform when  Fabric v1.4.3 was included and contains support for **Node OUs** in MSPs and channels. This new capability means that when the MSP admin identity is **enrolled** during MSP creation, the generated signed certificate includes the `admin` type as an OU inside the certificate instead of including the signed certificate of the admin identity in the `admincerts` folder of the MSP. You can learn more about the benefits of Node OUs in the Fabric documentation on the [Membership Service Provider](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/membership/membership.html#node-ou-roles-and-msps){: external}.

Because this functionality was not yet available when the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform service was initially offered, all MSP admin identities that were enrolled before Node OU support was added to the platform in December 2019,  do not contain the `admin` OU in their signing certificate. Instead, when the MSP was created, the signed cert for the MSP admin was placed in the `admincerts` folder. The platform supports both patterns, but if the Node OU configuration was not enabled when the MSP organization was created, additional steps are required after certificate renewal to update the MSP and any channels that the organization is part of. The detailed steps are included later in this section.

To determine whether your MSP organization is enabled with the Node OU configuration, open the MSP in the **Organizations** tab and examine the **Node OU** setting.

![Node OU configuration for MSP](../images/nodeou.png "Node OU configuration for MSP"){: caption="Figure 4. Node OU configuration for MSP" caption-side="bottom"}

#### Updating the organization MSP definition
{: #ibp-console-organizations-new-admins-steps}

If the organization MSP was not created with [Node OU](#ibp-console-organizations-nodeous) support enabled, then you also need to update the associated organization MSP definition with the new public admin certificate. When an organization MSP is created and Node OU configuration is enabled, the admin role is inserted directly into the generated admin certificate and therefore the MSP does not need to be updated.  When the Node OU configuration is not enabled, you need to perform the following additional steps:

1. Open the **Nodes** tab in your console.
2. Find the node that requires the admin certificate update. The MSP name is listed on the tile. Make a note of the MSP name.
3. Open the **Organizations** tab.
4. Locate the MSP tile for the organization and click the **Export** icon.
5. Open the downloaded MSP JSON file in a text editor.
6. Edit the `admins` element by pasting the new base64-encoded certificate string that you generated in the previous section to the end of the list of comma-separated admin certificates.
7. Save your changes.
8. In the **Organizations** tab, open the MSP tile for the peer and click the **Settings** icon.
9. In the side panel, click **Add file** and select the updated MSP JSON file.
10. Click **Update MSP definition**.

### Adding a new channel admin certificate
{: #ibp-console-organizations-new-admins-existing-channel}

Follow these instructions when you need to insert a new admin certificate for one that expired or add a new admin certificate of another member from the same organization who can instantiate a smart contract on an existing channel and can submit and approve channel updates. This task requires you to download and edit the existing MSP definition and add the new admin certificate and then update the MSP for the channel member.

If you need to add a new organization as a channel admin, see this topic on [Updating a channel configuration](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern#ibp-console-govern-update-channel).
{: note}

As with all channel updates, this update needs to be performed by a channel operator and the change will follow the channel update approval process according to the policy that was configured when the channel was created.

First, perform the same steps as above for [Updating the organization MSP definition](#ibp-console-organizations-new-admins-steps). Then, if the organization MSP was not created with the [Node OU](#ibp-console-organizations-nodeous) configuration enabled, you also need to update the associated channels that include the organization definition with the new public admin certificate. When the `Node OU` configuration is enabled, the admin role is inserted directly into the generated certificate and the channel MSP does not need to be updated. When the `Node OU` configuration is not enabled on the MSP, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Open the channel to be updated in the console.
2. Click **Channel details** and scroll down to **Channel members**.
3. Click the channel member that you want to update.
4. With the **Existing MSP ID** tab selected, browse to the updated MSP.
5. Click **Update MSP definition**.

## Manually building an MSP JSON file
{: #console-organizations-build-msp}

**This option is for advanced users only who are familiar with how certificates are used in blockchain identity management.**

If you prefer to use certificates for your peer or ordering service from an **external CA**, one that is not hosted by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, you need to build an MSP definition JSON file that represents the peer or ordering service organization MSP definition.

Note that all certificates must be encoded in base64 format.
{:important}

You can convert the contents of your certificate file, `<cert.pem>` from `PEM` format into a base64 string by running the following command on your local machine:

```
export FLAG=$(if [ "$(uname -s)" == "Linux" ]; then echo "-w 0"; else echo "-b 0"; fi)
cat <cert.pem> | base64 $FLAG
```
{:codeblock}


Create a JSON file by using the following format:

```json
{
    "display_name": "<organization_name>",
    "msp_id": "<organization_id>",
    "type": "msp",
    "admins": [
        "<admins>"
    ],
    "root_certs": [
        "<root_certs>"
    ],
    "tls_root_certs": [
        "<tls_root_certs>"
    ],
    "fabric_node_ous": {
        "enable": true,
        "admin_ou_identifier": {
            "certificate": "<ou_root_cert>",
            "organizational_unit_identifier": "admin"
        },
        "client_ou_identifier": {
            "certificate": "<ou_root_cert>",
            "organizational_unit_identifier": "client"
        },
        "orderer_ou_identifier": {
            "certificate": "<ou_root_cert>",
            "organizational_unit_identifier": "orderer"
        },
        "peer_ou_identifier": {
            "certificate": "<ou_root_cert>",
            "organizational_unit_identifier": "peer"
        }
    },
    "host_url": "<url>",
    "external": false
}
```
{:codeblock}

- **organization_name**: Specify any name to be used to identify this MSP definition in the console.
- **organization_id**: Specify an ID that is used to represent this MSP internally in the console.
- **root_certs**: Paste in an array that contains one or more root certificates from the external CA in `base64` format. You must provide either a CA root certificate or an intermediate CA certificate. You can also provide both.
- **admins**: Paste in the signing certificate of the organization admin in `base64` format.
- **tls_root_certs**: Paste in an array that contains one or more root certificates from the TLS CA in `base64` format. You must provide either an external TLS CA root certificate or an external intermediate TLS CA certificate, you can also provide both.
- **ou_root_cert**:
- **host_url**: Specify the URL of the blockchain console where this MSP will collect signatures.
- **fabric_node_OUs**: Fabric-specific OUs that enable identity classification. `NodeOUs` contain information for how to distinguish clients, peers, and orderers based on their OU. If the check is enforced, by setting Enabled to true, the MSP considers an identity valid only if it is an identity of type `client`, a `peer`, an `admin`, or an `orderer`. An identity should have only one of these special OUs, which are assigned to an identity when it is registered with the CA. See this topic for an example of [how to specify the `fabric_node_OU` in an MSP](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-cli.html#configuration-query){: external} in the Fabric Service Discovery documentation. Or learn more about using [Node OUs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/membership/membership.html#node-ou-roles-and-msps){: external} in Fabric.

The following additional fields are also available in your MSP definition but are not required:
- **intermediate_certs**: (if an intermediate CA was used) Paste in an array that contains one or more certificates from the external intermediate CA in `base64` format. You must provide either a CA root certificate or an intermediate CA certificate, you can also provide both.
- **tls_intermediate_certs**: (if an intermediate TLS CA was used) Paste in an array that contains one or more certificates from the intermediate TLS CA in `base64` format. You must provide either an external TLS CA root certificate or an external intermediate TLS CA certificate, you can also provide both.
- **organizational_unit_identifiers**: A list of Organizational Units (OU) that valid members of this MSP should include in their X.509 certificate. This is an optional configuration parameter that is used when multiple organizations leverage the same root of trust and intermediate CAs, and they have reserved an OU field for their members. An organization is often divided up into multiple organizational units (OUs), each of which has a certain set of responsibilities. For example, the ORG1 organization might have both ORG1-MANUFACTURING and ORG1-DISTRIBUTION OUs to reflect these separate lines of business. When a CA issues X.509 certificates, the OU field in the certificate specifies the line of business to which the identity belongs. See this topic in the Fabric documentation on [Identity Classification](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msp.html#identity-classification){: external} for more information.
- **revocation_list**: A list of certificates that are no longer valid. For X.509-based identities, these identifiers are pairs of strings that are known as Subject Key Identifier (SKI) and Authority Key Identifier (AKI), and are checked whenever the X.509 certificate is being used to make sure that the certificate has not been revoked. See this topic in the Fabric documentation for more information about [Certificate Revocation Lists](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/users-guide.html?highlight=revocation%20list#revoking-a-certificate-or-identity){: external}.

```
{:codeblock}

Save this definition as your MSP definition `JSON` file.

You have constructed an MSP definition, which defines the organization for your peer or ordering service nodes, and uses certificates from an external CA. You can now return to the instructions that describe [How to use certificates from an external CA with your peer or ordering node](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca).

## Importing an MSP
{: #console-organizations-import-msp}

Only the orderer admin can add new organizations to the consortium. If you are the orderer admin, you will need to collect the MSP definitions of all the organizations who have been invited to the consortium and import the MSPs into the console. You can then add the MSPs to the ordering service, by using the orderer node.

After an administrator creates an MSP definition, they can use the Organizations tab to download the MSP in JSON format to their local file system. They can then send you the MSP JSON file in an out of band operation. Navigate to the **Organizations** tab and use **Import MSP Definition** to import the MSP file into your console. Once an MSP definition is visible in the **Available organizations** section, you can then navigate to your orderer node to [add the organization to the consortium](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-add-consortium).

## Adding an organization to a consortium
{: #console-organizations-add-consortium}

The consortium of organizations is hosted by the ordering service.

If you are the administrator of the ordering service, you can use the console to add an organization to the consortium. Navigate to the **Nodes** tab and click the ordering service. On the ordering service panel, under **Consortium members**, click **Add organization**. A side panel opens where you can select from the list of available MSP definitions that you [imported into your organizations tab](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-import-msp). You can also use the **Upload JSON** option to import the MSP definition file created by another org directly.

## Creating and editing a channel
{: #console-organizations-create-channel}

After an organization is added to the consortium, the organization can use the ordering service to create a new channel or can be added to an existing channel. The information that allows you to participate in a channel, such as joining your peers to the channel, instantiating smart contracts, and submitting transactions, is provided by using the MSP definitions.

After your organization is added to a consortium, you can create a channel by using the following steps:

1. Import the ordering service that hosts the consortium into your console. You do not need to be an administrator of the ordering service; but you need to provide the ordering node name and endpoint information in your console.
2. Import the MSPs of organizations that you want to add to the new channel into your console in the **Organizations** tab. **Note** that organizations need to be added to the consortium before they can be added to a channel.
3. Navigate to the **Channels** tab and click **Create channel**. This opens a side panel that allows you to specify the channel name, membership, and channel policies. You can add any organizations that were added to the consortium to the new channel.

For more information about these steps, see [creating a channel](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network-create-channel1) in the **Build a network** tutorial.

### Updating an MSP in a channel definition
{: #console-organizations-update-channel}

Over time you might need to update the certificates in an MSP definition that is already associated with a channel. When that situation occurs follow these steps to update an organization's MSP definition in the channel:  

1. Navigate to the **Channels** tab in your console.
2. Click the channel that contains the organization MSP that you want to update and open it.
3. Click the **Channel details** tab.
4. Click the associated channel member's tile that you want to update.
5. If you have not already imported the updated MSP definition into the console, you can upload the file here. **Note:** This action will not update the associated MSP definition in the Organizations tab. If you have already updated the MSP definition in the Organizations tab of the console, you can select it from the drop-down list.

## Removing an organization
{: #console-organizations-remove}

If you want to stop using an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, you need to remove your organization from the blockchain network before you delete your service instance. This ensures that the removed organization is not affecting the governance of the network after you leave. You can remove your organization by using the following steps:

1. **Remove your organization from channels that you joined**. You need to [update the endorsement policy](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts#ibp-console-smart-contracts-endorse) of the smart contracts that are instantiated on the channel to remove your organization from the policy. If you do not update the endorsement policy, your organization might be required to endorse transactions after you have left the channel, causing transactions to fail.

  You can then update to the channel to remove your organization from the list of channel members. Navigate to the **Channels** tab and click the **Settings** icon. You can use the **Organizations** section to remove your organization from the channel. The channel **update policy** is updated to remove your organization automatically. When you are ready, click **Update channel** to submit a channel update request. The request starts the [process for collecting the signatures](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern#ibp-console-govern-update-channel-signature-collection) that are required to update the channel, depending on your update policy.

  After you remove your organization from the channel, you can delete your peers on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. If transactions can be successfully submitted to the network after you remove your peers, your organization is no longer required to endorse transactions.

2. **Have your organization removed from the consortium hosted by the ordering service.** After you are removed from the consortium, your organization can no longer be added to new channels. This action needs to be completed by an ordering service administrator.

  Navigate to the **Nodes** tab and click the ordering service of your network. On the ordering service panel, find the organization to be removed in the list of **Consortium members**. Click the **Delete** button in the corner of the organization MSP definition tile.

3. **Delete your ordering nodes.** If you operate ordering nodes that are part of a multi-node ordering service, you need to remove your ordering nodes from the network before you remove your ordering organization. Your ordering nodes need to be removed from the consenter set of each channel before they are removed from the ordering service.

  Navigate to the **Channels** tab and click the **Settings** icon to update the channel. You can use the **Consenter Set** section to remove your ordering node from the channel. When you are ready, click **Update channel** to submit the channel update request. The update request starts the [process for collecting the signatures](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern#ibp-console-govern-update-channel-signature-collection) that are required to update the channel, depending on the channel update policy. After you have you removed your ordering nodes, you can use the **Ordering service administrators** section to remove your organization from the set of orderer administrators.

  After you remove your ordering nodes from the consenter set of each channel, you can remove your nodes from the ordering service. Navigate to the **Nodes** tab and click the ordering service of your network. On the **Ordering service** panel, click the **Ordering nodes** tab. Click your ordering node and then click **Delete**. Because Raft consensus requires that a majority of ordering nodes are up to maintain a quorum, you need to remove one ordering node at a time. After you have deleted your ordering nodes, you can remove your organization from the set of ordering service administrators. Find your organization MSP definition on the list of **Orderer administrators** and click the **Delete** icon in the corner of the organization definition tile.

After you complete these steps, your organization will no longer affect the governance of the network. You can safely delete your [service instance of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks#ibp-v2-deploy-iks-delete-service-instance).
