## What is the value of using {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform over native Hyperledger Fabric?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-v2-IBP-Overview-1-7}
{: faq}

Hyperledger Fabric is a powerful, versatile, pluggable, open source, distributed ledger technology capable of addressing a wide variety of use cases across many industries. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform is {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s commercial distribution of Hyperledger Fabric. A key benefit of the platform is that  {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} tests the open source code for security vulnerabilities daily and provides 24x7x365 support with SLAs appropriate for production environments. The platform is the **commercial distribution of Hyperledger Fabric** and includes integrated tools that provide end to end features for developers and network operators to develop, test, operate, monitor, and govern Fabric components by using an intuitive console UI. Quickly deploy an instance and use the streamlined console UI to [build a network](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network), easily [install and instantiate smart contracts](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts), [govern your components](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern-components), and [govern your channel](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern). Interested in APIs? See the [{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/blockchain){: external}. With the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, it is easy to extend a basic network, work with multicloud solutions, and receive {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} worldwide support when needed. Finally, the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform provides additional security benefits that are essential for running an enterprise-grade production network.





## How can I find what version of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform that I am running?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-version}
{: faq}
{: support}

View the Support page by clicking the question mark icon <img src="../images/support-link.png" alt="Support link icon" width="30" style="width:30px; border-style: none"/> in the upper right corner of the page. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform version is visible under the page heading.

## What version of Hyperledger Fabric is being used with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-v2-Hyperledger-Fabric-3-1}
{: faq}


{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.7 and v2.x.



## What database do the peers use for their ledger?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-v2-IBP-Overview-1-3}
{: faq}
{: support}

You have the choice of either CouchDB or LevelDB when you configure your peer database. Because data is modeled differently in a Couch database than in a Level database, the peers in a channel must all use the same database type. See [LevelDB versus CouchDB](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-level-couch) to decide what is best for your business needs.

## Do you support using certificates from non-IBM Certificate Authorities?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-v2-external-certs}
{: faq}

Yes, you can bring your own certificates if they are issued by a CA that is X.509 compliant. The CA should sign by using ECDSA and the defaults should be set to use P256 curve. See this topic about [Using certificates from an external CA with your peer or ordering node](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca).

## I am currently using Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.x and want to move to {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} . Can I continue to use Raft?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-migrate-raft}
{: faq}

Yes. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}  uses Raft consensus. All of the applications and smart contracts that you are using on Fabric v1.4.x are able to work on your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network. However, no mechanism exists to migrate your ledger data from one network to another. Instead, you can reinstall your smart contract packages on your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network. See also [Can IBM Blockchain Platform components interoperate with Hyperledger Fabric components on the same network?](/docs/blockchain-sw-251?topic=blockchain-sw-251-ibp-v2-faq#ibp-v2-faq-interoperability).

## Is it possible to deploy blockchain nodes to multiple clouds from a single blockchain console?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-multicloud}
{: faq}

You cannot currently deploy blockchain nodes to multiple hosted cloud providers. However, you can use your console to operate a distributed multicloud network by importing nodes deployed by using consoles on other clouds.

## Is there a best practice for monitoring my blockchain resources?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-mon-res}
{: faq}
{: support}

You are responsible for the health monitoring and resource allocation of the blockchain nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. While requests against the nodes are being actively processed, you should be monitoring for spikes in resource consumption to avoid problems. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} recommends that you configure Sysdig and setup alerts to track when blockchain nodes are reaching their limits. See the tutorial on [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-sysdig) for more details.

You should be aware that JavaScript and TypeScript smart contracts require more resources than contracts written in Golang. Therefore, when you are allocating resources to your cluster, it is important to ensure adequate resources are available to your smart contract pods when they are instantiated on a channel and during transaction processing. The pods containing the smart contracts will consume as much resources as they need to function.
{: tip}

## If service discovery is on, will an endorsement request be routed to any peer on the network?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-service-discovery}
{: faq}

This will depend on whether your endorsement policy is set to "ANY", in which any peer can sign an endorsement request, or whether the policy is bound directly to an organization's peers. The service discovery information provided by the peer supplies two pieces of information, `Layouts` and `EndorsersByGroup`. With these two pieces of data, the SDK has the ability to send requests to peers in different organizations that meet the endorsement policy requirements. The Node.js SDK provides default code that uses the `Layouts` and `EndoresersByGroup` and sends the requests to the appropriate peers to meet the endorsement policy requirements. This existing logic can be customized to meet the business needs.

## What is the recommended way to manage private keys?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-hsm}
{: faq}

Because private keys are not stored by the platform, users are responsible for downloading and securing their private key. Therefore, when a higher level of security is required for private keys, an HSM is recommended. An HSM is a hardware appliance that performs cryptographic operations and provides the capability to ensure that the cryptographic keys never leave the HSM. Hyperledger Fabric supports HSM devices that implement the PKCS #11 standard. PKCS #11 is a cryptographic standard for secure operations, generation, and storage of keys. See [Configuring a node to use a Hardware Security Module (HSM)](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm) to learn more.

## Is {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform HIPAA ready?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-hippa}
{: faq}

Because HIPAA readiness is only relevant when platform components process Personal Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform does not need to be HIPAA ready. Customers should not store PHI or PII on the ledger since it is immutable and therefore cannot be deleted. Instead, the recommendation is to store all PHI or PII off ledger in another database and simply reference it from the ledger.

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} platform gives customers total control over their deployments, certificates, and private keys. The console simplifies and accelerates the process of deploying components into a Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} that is managed and controlled by the customer. As a reminder, because the customer owns the storage that is mounted to the containers, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not have access to or control over any of the data that the customer chooses to store in their ledger.

## What ports are used by the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform?
{: #ibp-v2-ports}
{: faq}

See the port information in the Security topic that addresses this for the [console](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-security#ibp-security-ibp-ports) and the [customer Kubernetes cluster](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-security#ibp-security-Kubernetes-ports). 

## Do ordering service Raft nodes use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for communication?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-raft-tls}
{: faq}

Yes. The Raft ordering service nodes are configured to use TLS communication. TLS is embedded in the trust model of Hyperledger Fabric. By default, server-side TLS is enabled for all communications using TLS certificates. TLS is used to encrypt the communication between your nodes and as well as between your nodes and your applications. TLS prevents man-in-the-middle and session hijacking attacks. All {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform components use TLS to communicate with each other.



## What types of off-chain databases are supported with the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-offchain-db}
{: faq}

As a best practice it is recommended that you do not query the entire blockchain ledger for the purpose of aggregation or reporting. If you want to build a dashboard or collect large amounts of data as part of your application, you can query an off chain database that replicates the data from your blockchain network. This allows you to understand the data on the blockchain without degrading the performance of your network or disrupting transactions.

You can use block or chaincode events from your application to write transaction data to an off-chain database or analytics engine. For each block received, the block listener application would iterate through the block transactions and build a data store by using the key/value writes from each valid transaction's read-write set. The [Peer channel-based event services](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/peer_event_services.html#peer-channel-based-event-services) provide replayable events to ensure the integrity of downstream data stores. For an example of how you can use an event listener to write data to an external database, see the [Off chain data sample](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/off_chain_data) in the Fabric samples.

Blockchain solutions can use any RDBMS or NoSQL DB such as {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloudant for offchain data storage. Hyplerledger Fabric does not govern, interact with, or manage off-chain databases. In most cases, the off-chain database is used for reference data and non-transactional data. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} has successfully built blockchain products and solution accelerators with Hyperledger Fabric and NoSQL databases such as OrientDB.

## Can I integrate my corporate LDAP server with the Certificate Authority (CA) in the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-ldap}
{: faq}

You cannot currently directly integrate your [LDAP](#x2481619){: term} server with the CA. However, you can use an external mechanism to generate X.509 certificates for the LDAP users. To use those certificates with a peer or ordering service, see these topics on [Using certs from an external CA for your peer or ordering service](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca) and
[Manually building an organization MSP](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-build-msp).  

Also, you cannot configure the blockchain console login authentication to use an LDAP user registry at this time.
{: note}

## What is the process for rotating certificates on a periodic basis?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-cert-mgmt}
{: faq}
{: support}

Just like passwords need to be regularly updated, identity certificates need to be renewed, a process also referred to as "certificate rotation". The platform displays certificate expiration dates for components throughout the console.  When a certificate expires, transactions on the the network will fail because the identity can no longer be trusted.  It is your responsibility to monitor those expiration dates and manage your certificate renewal accordingly. The process varies depending on the type of certificate, when it was generated, and for organization admin certificates, whether Node OU support was enabled on the MSP when the identity was enrolled. The platform attempts to renew the peer and ordering node enrollment certificates 30 days before they expire. See [Managing certificates](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-cert-mgmt) to learn more about the types of certificates that you need to monitor and how to renew them.

## What languages are supported for smart contracts?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-v2-IBP-Overview-1-4}
{: faq}
{: support}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform supports smart contracts that are written in Node.js, Golang, JavaScript, and Java. The new Hyperledger Fabric programming model currently supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Golang. If you are interested in preserving your existing application code, or by using Fabric SDKs for *Go*, you can still connect to your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network by using the lower-level Fabric SDK APIs.

## What version of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform works with the Ansible collection?
{: #ibp-v2-faq-ansible-version}

No. When the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform is configured with a multizone cluster in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes service, you can choose which zone a particular component (peer or ordering node) is deployed to, or you can let the console decide.  Then, when the node is subsequently deployed, Kubernetes "pins" the associated pod to the chosen zone. Pinning means that Kubernetes will not provision the pod in another zone in the event of a whole zone failure. And because the pods are pinned to specific zones, there is no need to access the same storage from another zone. Therefore, MZR storage is not required for {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform nodes.
